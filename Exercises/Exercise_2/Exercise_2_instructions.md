# Exercise 1.2

# === TASK ===

You have been given the following code:

```python
x = input("Please enter a number:\n")
y = input("Please enter another number:\n")

print(f"The numbers entered are {x} and {y}")
```

Make changes to this code so that your program outputs the result of multiplying ``x`` and ``y``.

For example, if the user enters ``4`` and ``5`` your program should output the following.

```
Please enter a number:
4
Please enter another number:
5
The result of multiplying 4 and 5 is 20.
```
***Note that to pass the tests you must have exactly the output above, apart from the numbers which will differ depending on what the user inputs.***

**Note:** you will have to do some casting of the input.
