# Indentation, WhiteSpace, and Blank Lines 

Python is unusual in that it requires indentation for lines of code. This will make more sense when we do ``if`` statements, ``while`` loops, and ``for`` loops. 

For now, all you need to know is:

* Do not put whitespace (spacing or tabs) in front of a line of code.
* Python doesn't care about blank lines.

***
# === TASK ===

Copy and paste this code into **main.py**.

```python
# This line is not indented properly. Fix this
  print("Indentation matters in Python")

# You will notice that we have blank lines
# Python doesn't care about these!

# There is extra whitespace inside the print statement 
# Python doesn't care about this
print("Hello World!"  )  
```

Run the code, and you will see an ```IndentationError``` exception on line 2.

This is due to the whitespace at the beginning of the line.

Fix this.

***NOTE: You will also see that the code has a red squiggly line. This is highlighting an error!***

Make sure to check the tests to see that you have passed them!

You can access the tests at any point by clicking on the tests option via the tools menu on the left-hand side of the window.
